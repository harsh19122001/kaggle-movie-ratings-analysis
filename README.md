# Kaggle Data Analysis with Pandas (Student Project)

This project covers exploratory data analysis on Kaggle’s movie ratings dataset using Pandas and NumPy. The goal was to build core data skills by understanding dataset structure, cleaning data, handling missing values, and performing descriptive statistics.

## What this project includes:
- Loading and exploring multiple CSV files
- Removing unused columns (timestamps)
- Inspecting rows and metadata using iloc and columns
- Summary statistics with describe(), mean, min, max, std, mode
- Checking and handling missing values (isnull, dropna)
- Filtering data based on conditions
- Visualizing distributions using histograms and boxplots

This project was completed as part of my Data Science learning journey.
